## Nigerian  
You wake up in Lagos to the echo of sirens and the sound of a radio announcement:  
“World War Three has begun. Citizens are advised to remain calm.”  

But calm is impossible in this situation.
Screams fill the air, rapid footsteps, and car horns blaring.
As you step outside, you find a folded note at your front-door.

The note reads:  

> “The one who chooses correctly will survive. 
> You have three paths. Choose wisely.”

Do you:  
1. Head to the airport, hoping to escape → (airport.md)  
2. Join the local defense unit → (defense.md)  
3. Search for the writer of the note → (mystery.md)

the action (.md) is just a placeholder for the next scene.
