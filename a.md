## American 
You are a soldier on the frontlines, representing your nation in the chaos of World War Three.  
The air is filled with smoke and the distant thunder of artillery.  
Your uniform is heavy, your weapon cold in your hands.  

In this moment, you realize that survival isnâ€™t guaranteed,  
but your duty is clear  fight for your homeland until the very end.
