#Stay Home

You stay inside your apartment, quickly gathering food, water, and whatever else you can carry. The news warns of possible attacks on major cities. Suddenly, the lights go out.

Choices:

A. [Check the basement for backup power](basement.md)

B. [Head to your neighbor’s apartment](stayHidden.md)

C. [Go outside to see what’s happening](outside.md)
