#Calling Family

You call your family in Toronto. The phone connects, but the signal is weak. They tell you the city is preparing for evacuation, but they beg you to come join them.

Choices:

A. [Pack up and travel to Toronto](goToronto.md)

B. [Stay in Ottawa—it’s too dangerous to leave](outside.md)

C. [Ask them to come meet you instead](stayHome.md)
