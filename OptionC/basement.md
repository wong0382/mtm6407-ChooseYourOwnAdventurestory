#Basement

You go down to the basement of your building and find a small group of neighbors already there with flashlights and supplies. They invite you to stay.

Choices:

A. [Stay and build a mini-community with them](/OptionC/community.md)

B. [Steal some supplies and leave](/OptionC/outside)

C. [Suggest moving together to the government shelter](/OptionC/goShelter.md)
